Ranking Interpretation - Key Points for Interview:

1. The aggregate ranking averages four metrics (PPL, BPC, Entropy, Gzip). While useful for overview, it can mask important typological differences between languages.

2. Morphologically complex languages (e.g., Finnish, Turkish) often show higher tokens-per-character ratios, which can inflate token-based metrics like perplexity even when the model has comparable understanding.

3. Always examine individual metrics and confidence intervals before drawing conclusions. A language ranking poorly on aggregate may excel on specific tokenizer-agnostic metrics like BPC.
